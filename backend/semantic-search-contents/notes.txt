- Create pipeline to index a note and return the document ID
- Store the returned document ID into the notes database

Update functions in 'useNotes.tsx' file:
- handleNewNote() needs to add an empty document ID when creating note record
- handleSaveNote() needs to call embedding API to store embedding
- handleDeleteNote() needs to call embedding API to delete embedding

When the auto-categorize function is called:
- Embed the current note, do a semantic search, and return the top 5 results
- For each result from the semantic search, loop through the document IDs and retrieve their scores and query notes db for the folder of that note
- Present the results to the LLM with a modified prompt to determine where the new note should be categorized.
