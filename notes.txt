const { notes, folders, handleMoveNote, handleNewFolder } = useNotes();

I'll need the code above to handle folder move management.

1. Grab all notes where folderId = "unassigned" -> Uncategorized notes only
2. Loop through each uncategorized note and send relevant data to 'categorize-note' api call
3. Build a JSON object which stores the following:
   a. Note information
   b. Suggested Folder name (from API call)
   c. Folder ID (if it exists) or null if a new folder name
4. Push this JSON list to the dialogue pop-up
5. Dialog pop-up can allow user to modify the folder name
   a. Need to build a mechanism to update folder ID if the name is modified (or put as nothing)
   b. Once "save" is hit, dialog pop-up will close and change the JSON list
6. For each item in the JSON list, call handleMoveNote() (if the folderID is present) (else call handleNewFolder if folderID is null)
